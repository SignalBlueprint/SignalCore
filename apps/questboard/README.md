# Questboard

Questboard is a task management system that combines the Questline task framework with Working Genius team assignment principles, all orchestrated by a daily Questmaster role.

The system helps teams organize work into questlines (connected sequences of tasks), assigns work based on team members' Working Genius profiles (Wonder, Invention, Discernment, Galvanizing, Enablement, Tenacity), and uses a rotating Questmaster role to prioritize and coordinate daily activities.

## Features

- Questline-based task organization
