# Demoapp

**Status:** 🔴 Placeholder - No functionality
**Port:** Not configured

This is a placeholder app with no defined purpose. It requires either definition or removal from the suite.

## Purpose

**Purpose is currently undefined.** This app was created as a placeholder but has not been developed into a functional application.

## Current State

- Minimal `package.json`
- Single `index.ts` with console.log only
- Empty README template
- No API endpoints
- No UI
- No storage
- No integration with suite packages

## Potential Use Cases

If this app is to be kept, it could serve one of the following purposes:

### Option 1: Demo/Sandbox App
- Testing ground for new suite features
- Playground for prototyping shared packages
- Example app for documentation and tutorials
- Integration testing environment

### Option 2: Template App
- Starter template for creating new suite apps
- Reference implementation of suite architecture
- Boilerplate with best practices
- Quick start for new developers

### Option 3: Integration Testing App
- End-to-end testing across suite
- Test suite integration patterns
- Validate shared package functionality
- CI/CD testing environment

### Option 4: Remove
- If no clear purpose exists, remove this app
- Clean up monorepo structure
- Reduce maintenance burden
- Simplify suite architecture

## Next Steps

**Decision Required:** Determine the fate of this app:

1. **If Keeping** - Define clear purpose and implement functionality
   - Choose one of the use cases above
   - Update package.json with proper metadata
   - Implement core functionality
   - Add proper README with documentation
   - Add to suite registry with clear description
   - Create example code and usage patterns

2. **If Removing** - Clean up the codebase
   - Delete `apps/demoapp` directory
   - Remove from workspace configuration
   - Update main README to remove references
   - Update SUITE_MAP.md to remove entry
